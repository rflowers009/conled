# conled

Conled is an abbreviation for "Constant-Ledger", a website name I came up with.
It could also be considered an abbreviation for "Contacts/Ledger", a more
general descrption. The "ledger" part is a micro-blogging service. The "contact"
part is a public contact database for public officials, CEOs, etc.
